  Scenario: Service with a DNS name can not by pass Egressnetworkpolicy with that DNS name
    Given the env is using multitenant network
    Given I have a project
    Given I have a pod-for-ping in the project
    And evaluation of `project.name` is stored in the :proj1 clipboard

    # Create egress policy
    When I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/egress-ingress/dns-egresspolicy2.json"
    And I replace lines in "dns-egresspolicy2.json":
      | 98.138.0.0/16 | 0.0.0.0/0 |
      | yahoo.com | www.test.com |
    And I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | dns-egresspolicy2.json |
      | n | <%= cb.proj1 %> |
    Then the step should succeed

    # Create a service with a "externalname"
    When I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/service-externalName.json"
    And I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | service-externalName.json |
      | n | <%= cb.proj1 %> |
    Then the step should succeed

    # Check curl from pod
    When I execute on the pod:
      | curl |-ILs  | --head | www.test.com |
    Then the step should fail

    # Delete egress network policy
    Given I switch to cluster admin pseudo user
    When I run the :delete client command with:
      | object_type       | egressnetworkpolicy |
      | object_name_or_id | policy-test         |
      | n                 | <%= project.name %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    And the output should contain:
      | egressnetworkpolicy |
      | deleted             |

    # Create egress policy
    When I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/egress-ingress/dns-egresspolicy2.json"
    And I replace lines in "dns-egresspolicy2.json":
      | 98.138.0.0/16 | 0.0.0.0/0 |
      | yahoo.com | www.cisco.com |
    And I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | dns-egresspolicy2.json |
      | n | <%= cb.proj1 %> |
    Then the step should succeed

    # Check curl from pod
    When I execute on the pod:
      | curl | -ILs | --head | www.test.com |
    And the output should contain "HTTP/1.1 200
