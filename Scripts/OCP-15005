  Scenario: Service with a DNS name can not by pass Egressnetworkpolicy with that DNS name	
    Given the env is using multitenant network
    Given I have a project
    Given I have a pod-for-ping in the project
    And evaluation of `project.name` is stored in the :proj1 clipboard

    # Create egress policy
    When I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/networking/egress-ingress/dns-egresspolicy2.json"
    And I replace lines in "dns-egresspolicy1.json":
      | 98.138.0.0/16 | 0.0.0.0/0 |
      | yahoo.com | www.test.com |
    And I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | dns-egresspolicy1.json |
      | n | <%= cb.proj1 %> |
    Then the step should succeed
    
    # Create a service with a "externalname"
    When I download a file from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weliang1/Openshift_Networking/master/OCP/Egress-DNS/service-externalName.json"
    And I run the :create admin command with:
      | f | service-externalName.json |
      | n | <%= cb.proj1 %> |
    Then the step should succeed 
     
     
     
     
     
    # Check ping from pod
    When I execute on the pod:
      | ping | -c2 | -W2 | www.cisco.com |
    Then the step should fail
    When I execute on the pod:
      | ping | -c2 | -W2 | www.facebook.com |
    Then the step should succeed

    # Check egress rule added in openflow
    Given I select a random node's host
    When I run commands on the host:
       | (ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 -O openflow13 \| grep tcp \|grep table=100 \| grep tp_dst=53  \|\| docker exec openvswitch ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 -O openflow13 | grep tcp  |grep table=100 | grep tp_dst=53 )  |
    And the output should contain 1 times:
      | nw_dst=<%= cb.hostip %> |
      When I run commands on the host:
       | (ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 -O openflow13 \| grep udp \|grep table=100 \| grep tp_dst=53  \|\| docker exec openvswitch ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 -O openflow13 | grep udp  |grep table=100 | grep tp-dst=53 )  |
    And the output should contain 1 times:
      | nw_dst=<%= cb.hostip %> |
